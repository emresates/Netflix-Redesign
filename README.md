## Here is the Netflix redesign I made and all codes belongs to me :blush: :computer:

#### When you click "Play Trailer" button, It starts playing the trailer. When you click again, it stops. "My List" button is also changing. When you click, It changes to "In My List". Of course It doesn't have a function. Only the text changes. 

#### There are two handle buttons in each slider. When you click , It scrolls and shows the next movies/series. When you hover the section It shows itself. There is also progress bar for that. You can see it under the "See All". It's also functional. If you go to the end and press the progress button again, It returns to the beginning. Netflix put it on loop but then you don't realize It's back to the beginning. 

#### I was going to add trailer playback to all movies/series when hovered like on Netflix. But this feature didn't work as the poster is horizontal in Netflix and vertical in my version. If you still want to see it, you can hover over the "Prison Break" in the Newly Released Series part. It starts when you hover, It stops when you not.
